# Reply Code Challenge

This repository contains my code for the [Reply Code Challenge Teen Edition](https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/coding_teen).

All of the code (except the training challenges) was used in the actual competition. The formatting of the code has been slightly improved for readability and extra comments have been added to explain what is going on.

> _**Please keep in mind that the code in this repository has been written for a competition so it is not designed to look nice, be robust or anything like that.** There are definitely some lines of code that I'm not a fan of in here!_

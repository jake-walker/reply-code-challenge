# Reply Code Challenge

This repository contains my code for the [Reply Code Challenge Teen Edition](https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/coding_teen).

All of the code (except the training challenges) was used in the actual competition. The formatting of the code has been slightly improved for readability and extra comments have been added to explain what is going on.

> _**Please keep in mind that the code in this repository has been written for a competition so it is not designed to look nice, be robust or anything like that.** There are definitely some lines of code that I'm not a fan of in here!_

### Scoreboard

The code for the Scoreboard challenge, worked upto input 5 where my code didn't manage to calculate an output within the 2 minute time window.

### Bandwidth

The code for the Bandwidth challenge didn't work in time for the end of the competition. This challenge was very difficult to get a hold of. I managed to simplify the '5G network' from the brief into a grid that has vertical and horizontal separations.
